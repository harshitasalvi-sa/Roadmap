Product card:

I applied Props and state.
i made reusable component product card,
dynamically added product details from products object, and looped thru that using map function,
I applied conditional rendering,
useEffect for persistent UI, as it saves value of count to localstorage whenever there is change is count state,



Created a todo list with reacgt with components like Container that bundles todo list
and task that represents individual task list item in task list

I chose floral theme for it and made it localStorage perisitent

I added update toggle, delete task

TO ADD :
Edit task
